    <p><strong>"The web is what we make it"</strong></p>
    <p>This quote sums up the web quite well, in my opinion. The reading also made me think about the permanance of some parts of the web and what that means. Though it's not a handmade website, I was brought back to my memories of someone from tumblr who passed away a few years ago. Their blog is still available for their friends and family to view and reminisce about their time together, and that is something quite beautiful yet haunting about the web. </p>
