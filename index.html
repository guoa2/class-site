      <li><a href="about.html"> About Me </a></li>
      <div class="reveal" style="background-color: #fffcc2;">
      <li><a href="article/index.html" target="_blank"> Article Project </a></li>
      <p>Choose an interview or article from here, ideally one with multiple levels of hierarchy and images.</p>

      <p>Translate this article into HTML. Focus on hierarchy and using the most specific elements to organize the content. If the original article does not have images, add a few relevant images throughout.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- <li><a href="article/variation1/index.html" target="_blank"> Article Variation 1</a></li> -->
      <div class="reveal" style="background-color: #fffcc2;">
      <li><a href="article/variation2/index.html" target="_blank"> Article Variation</a></li>
      <p>For this part, create a new version using different CSS stylesheets for the article. You’ll want to treat these as separate websites, with new distinct folders. You can copy the HTML document that you wrote in Part 1, but for each variation you’ll have a different stylesheet (though you may need to or want to alter parts of the HTML document to work with the CSS).</p>

      <div class="reveal" style="background-color: #fffcc2;">
      <li><a href="flexbox/index.html" target="_blank"> Flexbox Exercise</a></li>
      <p>The flexbox is one method we can use to start to create dynamic (flexible) layouts, grids, and compositions on our web pages. A flexbox has two basic parts: the flex container and flex items.</p>

      <div class="reveal" style="background-color: #fffcc2;">
      <li><a href="secret/index.html" target="_blank"> Secret Project</a></li>
      <p>Make a website that functions as a secret, or a gem, or a treasure, or a whisper. Think of it as something that has value to you/others but whose value would be diminished/destroyed if accessed easily (like if it was broadcast on social media).</p>
      </div>

      <li><a href="reading2.html">Reading Response 2</a></li>

      <div class="reveal" style="background-color: #fffcc2;">
      <li><a href="responsive exercise/index.html" target="_blank">Responsive Exercise</a></li>
      <p>Make a small sketch website that has 3 or more distinct layouts (using at least 2 different media queries) for different screen sizes. Use relative units to size the elements (try using em or rem for responsive type sizing).</p>
      </div>

      <li><a href="reading3.html">Reading Response 3</a></li>

      <div class="reveal" style="background-color: #fffcc2;">
      <li><a href="screensaver/index.html" target="_blank"> Screensaver Project</a></li>
      <p>Screensavers are now antiquated pieces of software that were originally designed to prevent CRT screen burn-in. Modern screens don’t have this problem anymore, but screensavers remain (though increasingly less common) as a relic of early home computing. The screensaver was a moment for the computer to rest and to dream in its own way, without the control of the user.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="reveal" style="background-color: #fffcc2;">
      <li><a href="final/index.html" target="_blank"> Final Project</a></li>
      <p>The final project can be whatever you would like. There are no guidelines except that it should be personal. This is your moment to add a brick to the digital village, a flower to the online garden, a droplet of water in the cloud. Consider all the websites we’ve looked at and collected so far.</p>
