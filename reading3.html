    <p> This reading led to me realize that I haven't really used a library properly for a very long time. Of course, there is no real "way" or "method" of using a library but I feel as if I haven't been properly taking advantage of all the resources at my disposal. I can't remember the last time I checked out a library book and actually read it. Nowadays I only go to the library when I need to print something or to borrow a projector. Though all in all, it's not misusing the library, it's just that my needs have already been met without it most of the time. </p>
